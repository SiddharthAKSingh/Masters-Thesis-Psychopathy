            " my very first contemplation of criminal behavior was trying to uh put together a plan of getting away with murder and i was gonna kill my brother i knew that every sunday id jump on his bike and hed head down the road to join up with some other fellas and he loved that bike and he used to tell me you ever touch my bike ill kill you so this sunday morning while hes working i take his bike i knew if i had provoked it just a little bit more that he would chase me so i gave him a couple of kicks and took off on a dead run for a tree that was right beside my grandfathers barn and it went up onto the roof and on the opposite side of the barn there were cutter rakes and sure enough he chased me up there and as he uh topped edge of that roof i kicked him and he fell onto those rakes some court people came got me i stabbed my first man um i uh stabbed him uh he lived but it sent out a word a clear word to the rest of them that uh you dont wanna be messing with this kid hell stick ya this particular unit represents the uncontrollable the undesirables the ones that refuse to program is what they refer to as the most disruptive im here serving a five to twenty year sentence for sexually molestation of four boys the ages of four to twelve okay uh well im uh i just turned forty five uh the twenty third of january uh i keep to myself i do a great deal of studying i do a great deal of reading i do a great deal of writing the therapists are wonderful uh i learn a great deal from them uh sometimes it can be hard i suppose thats the way its supposed to be when youre growing up uh im ready to go now i know that that decision will come from others who have already seen they seen my change i i knew that i had to get in touch with some deeper level of of interconnection so that i could identify with humanity were all born with a conscience we learn not to touch the stove because its hot until we touch the stove and get burned then and only then we dont touch the stove again compassion and empathy is a learned process it starts off at a very early age my idol is john lennon and of course on the other side of the tracks have willie nelson he represents uh freedom in in different ways uh love peace harmony uh togetherness connection with the polar bears and uh freedom in general and of course the feathers represent freedom and uh the leaf represents uh changing of the times and uh theres something some little thing that i stuck together and my philosophy is its our life and we have a right to cry if we want to i believe in science i believe in the study of of the mind but its very complex im not sure if there will be in my lifetime any ground made on that and so for the time being we have to look at what we have in regards to forms of prevention we have to protect people we have to protect society and i understand that today \n",
            "i had a statutory rape on a minor fifteen uh then i was arrested for an aggravated sexual assault on a on a female child she was four years old its not good for me to be around any female child whether it be a young child or a teenager uh one of my main concerns is that when i re someday return to society is that im gonna have to be very careful where im at at all times and who im around\n",
            " yes thats true i grew up in a wonderful home with two dedicated and loving parents one of five brothers and sisters but as a young a a young boy and i mean the boy of uh twelve or thirteen certainly that i encountered outside the home again in um the local grocery store the local drugstore the soft core pornography what people call soft core um but as i think i i explained to you last night doctor dobson in an anecdote that as young boys do we explore the the back roads and sideways and byways of our neighborhood and oftentimes people would dump the garbage and whatever theyre cleaning out of their house and from time to time we come across pornographic books of a harder nature than more of uh graphic you might say more explicit nature than we would encounter lets say in your local grocery store my experience with id say pornography generally but with pornography that deals on a violent level with the sexuality um is it once you become addicted to it and i look at this as a kind of addiction uh like other kinds of addiction of addiction you keep i would keep looking for more potent more explicit more graphic kinds of material like an addiction you keep craving something which is harder harder something which which gives you a greater uh sense of uh of uh excitement until you reach the point where the pornography only goes so far you reach that jumping off point where you begin to wonder if if maybe actually doing it will give you that which is beyond just reading about it or looking at it it was like coming out of some kind of horrible trance or or dream um i can only liken it to after you know i i dont want to overdramatize it but to have been possessed by something so awful and so alien and then the next morning wake up from it remember what happened and realize that basically um in in in the eyes of the law certainly in the eyes of god youre responsible to have to wake up in the morning and and realize what i had done and with a clear mind and all my essential moral and ethical feelings intact at that moment absolutely horrified that i was capable of doing something like that basically i was a normal person uh i wasnt uh some guy hanging out uh at bars or a bum or uh i wasnt a pervert in the sense that you know people look at somebody and say i know theres something wrong with him and just tell i mean i uh i was essentially a normal person i had good friends i i uh i live a normal life except for this one small but very potent and very destructive segment of it that i kept very secret very close to myself and didnt let let anybody know about it and part of the shock and horror from my dear friends and family years ago when i was first arrested was that they just there was no clue they looked at me and they looked at the you know the um the all american boy and im i mean i wasnt perfect but its its i wanna be quite candid with you i was i was okay okay uh i was the basic humanity and basic spirit that god gave me was intact but it unfortunately became overwhelmed at times i think people need to recognize that its not some kind of those of us who are who have been so much influenced by violence in the media in particular pornographic violence are not some kinds of inherent monsters we are your sons and we are your husbands and we grew up in regular families and pornography can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today he snatched me out of my it snatched me out of my home twenty thirty years ago and as diligent as my parents were uh and they were diligent in protecting their children and as good a christian home as we had and we had a wonderful christian home uh there is no protection against the kind that the kinds of influences that are loose in the society that that that tolerates listen uh im no social scientist and i havent done a survey i mean i i dont pretend that i know what john q citizen thinks about this but ive lived in prison for a long time now and ive met a lot of men who were motivated to commit violence just like me and without exception every one of them was deeply involved in pornography without question without exception deeply influenced and consumed by an addiction to pornography theres no question about it the fbis own study on serial homicide shows that the most common interest among serial killers is pornography and its and its real its true yeah well i i know it would have been far better not just for me and and its excuse me for being so self centered here it wouldve been a lot better for me and lots of other people i know that lots of other innocent people victims and families it would have been a lot better theres no question but it it would have been a a a fuller life uh certainly a life that would not have involved im absolutely certain would not have evolved involved this kind of violence that i have been that i have committed yes absolutely in the past few days myself and a number of investigators have been talking about unsolved cases murders that i was involved in and its hard to its hard to talk about all these years later because it revives in me all those terrible feelings and those thoughts that i have steadfastly and and and uh diligently dealt with i think successfully with the love of god and yet its reopened that and i felt the pain and i felt the horror again of all that and i can only hope that those who i have harmed those who ive caused so much grief even if they dont believe my expression of sorrow and remorse we all believe what im saying now that there is loose in their towns in their communities people like me today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in and day out by violence in the media in its various forms particularly sexualized violence and what scares me and lets come into the present now because what im talking about happened thirty twenty thirty years ago that is in my formative stages and what scares and appals me doctor dobson is when i see whats on cable tv some of the movies i mean some of the violence in the movies uh they come into homes today with stuff that they that they wouldnt show in x rated adult theaters thirty years ago this stuff that stuff is im telling you from personal experience the most that is graphic violence on screen particularly as it gets into the home to children who may be unattended or or unaware that they may be a ted bundy who has that that vulnerability to that that predisposition to be influenced by that kind of behavior by that kind of of of uh movie that kind of violence there are kids sitting out there switching the tv dial around and come upon these movies late at night or i dont know when theyre on but theyre on and any kid can watch them its scary when i think what would have happened to me if i had seen that was scary enough i mean then i just ran into stuff outside the home but to to know that children are watching that kind of thing today or can pick up their phone and dial away for it or send away for it but ill tell you there are lots of other kids playing in streets around this country today who who are going to be dead tomorrow and the next day and the next day and next month because other young people are reading the kinds of things and seeing the kinds of things that are available in the media today i do i cant say that uh being in the the valley of the shadow of death is is something that ive become all that accustomed to and then i you know and that im strong and uh nothings bothering me uh listen its no fun its its uh you know its its uh its its kinda lonely and yet i have to remind myself that every one of us will go through this someday in one way or another and countless millions who have walked this earth before us have so this is just an experience which we all share\n",
            " paul jason teal aka paul bernardo yeah im and it makes sense what about ones that you thought that i came forward with and maybe thought that i didnt do was there any of those okay um problem uh i turned on the tv i waited for peel regional to come by september rolls around they they make a public announcement its written on my file here that uh that i lied to police and i did not commit the crimes that i said i committed depends on peel regional big problem well ive been sitting with this for years and its its written on my file and it makes me seem like oh its just this crazy you know you guys love doing that im this crazy psychopathic liar its like why was that statement issued why didnt they come in and talk to me if they didnt have enough information we were waiting on that tape you can play that tape back i i asked you guys if pure regional gonna come in i sat there month after month after month no one came i turned on the tv in september pew you know declared that paul bernardo was you know this crazy liar to to to police what what whats the fundamental problem here well i i know i mean justice the canadian way and uh and and and no one comes in and now you guys are saying that you didnt have enough information that statement youre giving me is much different than the public statement they said which said i was a liar friday day and they didnt come in if they didnt have enough information why dont you come in and get the information i mean either im lying or im not lying and this goes to the crux of this argument either im a liar to you im a liar to you right now about everything like i did to peel regional according to their story or not you know i i just i just i im not gonna sit here you know come voluntarily and have people come you guys ban me from the press you you roll your stories over and constantly say that im a liar im a liar i made a mistake seventeen years ago said okay fine i did but but now were talking about today and youre not gonna roll forward that im some psychopathic liar sitting in jail claiming other peoples responsibilities for other crimes this is a total cross examination point you wanna start this thing brent lockdair is gonna grab a hold of it and say well he lied about other crimes you know hes a hes a crazy liar why didnt you guys resolve this the good guys are the bad guys you know what i mean youre on the same team this thing they they should subpoena these guys for peel regional they can bring in all the facts to show just where i lied if im a liar thats what i say to do because i either am a liar or im not a liar and im not a liar but you guys are trying to paint me as one the public court to the public they they turn on the tv in september of last year i was this crazy liar uh thats what the tv reported and not only did they report it there they wrote it on my file ive got it right myself paul bernardo uh peel regional said paul bernardo lied to police about crime he didnt commit said he did i i mean this is this thats just awful i mean come on enough manipulation you know what i mean either you tell the truth or dont otherwise the whole purpose of any interview is just stupid because if im this crazy liar ill be just sitting here lying to you by everything right right i mean why wouldnt i im just this crazy liar its its its one thing its you know im a human being and and to say that im a dangerous offender and raping and killing all stuff is fine i mean for your public get that you know tough on crime get that back at but but when you go to a certain point of mine its just i mean it affects me totally you know i made mistakes i made mistakes long time ago but dont say that today about me because then were lying and then we got a big problem because im looking at you and youre the bad guys because im not doing anything wrong im not telling the truth and you guys are walking around issuing statements that i lied here i lied there no well thats again i know but i mean this is its attorney general who sent you guys down here hes fighting the case hes taking this bald bitch back right so its its really all the its the same organization this is the attorney general i see tv talking right its still attorney generals office yeah you know its its its the same thing if im a liar take the facts that uh that they have they come down and talk to me any cross examine uh you know any defense lawyer call them up and show me where im lying because youre not gonna find it maybe theres a minor mistake here and there i think i have one thing about some uh tree driveway below trees where you know the memory a little bit over time but to say that is just ridiculous just like you guys did go uh you guys polygraph the problem here ask her to vote it nobody from the attorney generals went down there nobody care again its the same i dont but its the same problem because youre making me out to be a huge liar and and this this is a problem exactly so but this is was different story that ive got on my file and but but it is part of the focus well it is i mean youre aware of but dealing with me and it comes down to credibility well it well yeah go just making my point on it because its gonna have to be addressed sometime it should have been we we dealt with that a year and a bit ago so yeah well not quite a year actually i think we discovered that actually i was referring you guys tell the truth youre opening up cans of worms everywhere you know that goes back to you guys polygraph the world with carla you didnt polygraph carla and then in two years since have you guys gone down there and asked her have you settled the matter with it because you could say i lied or whatever on polygraph but have you asked her because it it it it comes down to a lot of that issue you know i mean have you asked her has the attorney general gone deaf okay in answer to your question i dont wanna go off on tangents but all these all these issues are relevant i know you think darren but but they are in answer to your question is we had some discussion on it but when corcoran from the opp came down before carla was released right i told him id be willing to take the polygraph on anything and everything would you in turn are you going to go down before you release card just ask her shes not gonna take it shes gonna gonna fail on on all these issues did her hand cause to sdf and did it blah blah blah did this tammy happen in july it was a girl in january actually kidnapped and they got somebody i picked up in a bar that she tried to to to move over and all all these other issues all relevant all relevant and and so and then i addressed it to you guys when you came back again uh last year i said yeah ill take a polygraph on anything because i im not telling a lie on the thing are you have you again i asked the question have you guys gone down or you know i carlas free now im not im not in the business of putting her in jail its not my thing but my point was did you ask her the question just so we get the story straight i mean if she refuses well theres theres a reason why shes refusing and again you guys couldnt provide answer and now almost a year later again you dont provide the answer so i mean you know i i dont know what youre asking me youre me to take a polygraph when you arent willing to ask her yeah no i just just wanted for the record that i gave you good information which you guys couldve independent of me couldve verified my story or not and whether you guys do or denies your business like said im not a prosecutor im not here to point finger at anyone but i i showed you where to go so if you guys dont do that its your business but you know to me its like if you didnt why didnt you if you wanna know the truth about things yeah yeah a loaded question i mean are we gonna go back and then and and and go the the time sequence of what happened in my life i mean i i could just give a yes or no answer but you know theres a lot of issues about that know the karlas and my role who did what where when this is why i said that you guys you know go down there to get a polygraph to get to see if she was telling the truth like why didnt devon do it in the first place i mean hes polygraphing over the camaro why would he make a deal with someone and not give them a polygraph its not incomprehensible to me uh you know because now im sitting my file says her version and its a lie \n",
            " hey youre lucky you came up on a day when theres no snow it was snowing like crazy all weekend yeah uh slow and steady nothing uh nothing out of the ordinary billy yes yes i read the book uh uh my dad sent it to me uh about last last week and uh spent all night reading it i was up all night reading it it was uh quite a surprise to me some parts of it very interesting uh just uh some of the things that were were revealed uh caught me off guard and uh just some some very big surprises enough for me uh some of some of his insights into uh what he thought of me as i was growing up no we we dont discuss that because uh its been its been going over so thoroughly in the papers and and the media that uh theres just really no point in in going indepth into any indepth talks about it we we talk about uh our family um home how things used to be uh what uh prison life is here is like here now and try to keep things as as light and upbeat as possible no not not the good things in fact it gives me a sense of comfort to talk about uh the the few good times there were in the past no not profoundly my childhood wasnt wasnt uh filled with any any great tragedies there anything there were good times and there were bad times i i think it was fairly normal in ninth grade uh in biology class we had uh the usual dissection of fetal pigs i took the remains of that home and and kept uh the skeleton of it and i just started branching out dogs cats i suppose it could have turned into a a normal hobby like taxidermy but it it didnt veered off into into this why i i dont know all i know is that uh i wanted to to see what the insides of these animals looked like there it was no no sexual pleasure but just uh its hard to describe i suppose thats a good way of putting it i dont know thats it it became a compulsion and it switched from animals to humans i i i still dont understand it i dont know why take them back in the woods skin them sometimes slit them slit them all the way open uh look at the organs feel them there was a sort of uh general excitement for me i dont know why it was exciting to see i think it was around age fourteen or fifteen started have having obsessive uh thoughts of of violence uh intermingled with sex and it just got worse and worse i didnt know how to tell anyone about it so i didnt i just kept it all inside no no ive ive talked with uh a few psychologists about it they they have their theories but they dont have any concrete answers either no not really i i dont know where where it came from probably will never know but i i never i never dreamed that it would uh become a reality from fifteen on i i had this reoccurring fantasy of uh of uh meeting a hitchhiker on the road and uh of taking him hostage and and doing what i wanted about three years later i was eighteen years old driving home uh i saw this hitchhiker about a mile from my house thought to myself should i stop and pick him up or should i just keep on going i wish i just keep on kept on going but i didnt i turned around picked him up and uh thats when thats when it the nightmare became a reality it it just seems so bizarre to me that this obsession that i had been thinking about and wanting just uh all the all the parts are there and they make it possible to make it happen the house was empty my uh mother was up in chippewa falls with her family and my dad was living in a in a rented motel about five miles away due to the divorce and uh i i pretty much had the the place to myself i was drinking a lot during that time and just uh i dont know looking for something to uh some way to find some fulfillment some some pleasure and i acted on my fantasies and uh thats where everything went wrong right once it happened the first time it just seemed like uh it had control of my life from there on in the second occurrence was nineteen eighty four roughly and i met this guy at one of the uh bars downtown milwaukee he bars we went back to the hotel just planning on uh getting drunk i had put some sleeping pills in his drink to render him unconscious and was just gonna spend the night with him when i woke up in the morning uh my forearms were bruised and his chest was was bruised and blood was coming out of his mouth he was hanging over the side of the bed and uh i have no memory of beating him to death but i must have and thats when it when it all started again right that thats when the the obsession went into full swing yes after after the second time it seemed like the compulsion to do it was too strong and i i didnt even try to stop it after that but uh after before the second time things have been building up gradually uh going to bookstores going to uh the bars the gay bars bath clubs when that when that wasnt enough uh buying sleeping pills and and using it on uh various guys in the bath clubs it just escalated slowly but surely and uh after the second time which was not planned uh it was out of control it felt like it was out of control it was a big part of it my my only objective was to find the the best looking uh guy that i could their sexual reference didnt matter to me no their race didnt matter to me the first the first two young men were white the third young man was american indian the fourth and fifth were hispanic so no race had nothing to do with it it was just their looks as time went on uh yes i i did get a there was a sexual part part to that uh i started saving the the skeletons man and preserving other parts and uh one thing led to another it took it took more and more uh deviant type behaviors to satisfy uh my urges and so i just spiraled out of control it it made me feel like they were a permanent part of me besides besides them just mere curiosity of what it would be like it made them feel that they were a part of me and it it gave me a a sexual uh satisfaction to do that no the the killing was just a means to an end that that was the least uh satisfactory part i didnt enjoy doing that thats why i tried to create uh living zombies with uh uric acid the in the drill uh but it it never worked no the killing wasnt wasnt the objective i just wanted to have the person under my complete control not having to to consider their wishes being able to keep in there as long as i wanted uh its not easy to say that but thats thats what the motive was i dont know maybe i felt uh i had no control a as a child or young adult and uh that got mixed in with my sexuality and i ended up doing what i did was my way of of feeling in in complete control at least for that situation creating my own little world where i had the final say uh finding the best looking guy that i could and uh having total mastery over him for as long as i wanted lust played a big part of it controlling lust that uh that was the motive right there no not indepth i talked at great length with with uh psychiatrists court appointed psychiatrists psychologists but uh not with my family not on an not on any deep deep level no we talked about superficial things uh never really had a a real deep heart to heart talk about what was going on inside our own minds i was i was always a very private person i didnt like to uh open up and and share anything with anyone uh i like to keep my thoughts to myself uh because from uh about fifteen years on up uh great deal of my thoughts were uh basically unshareable with anyone so i just uh closed myself off and put on uh a mask of normalcy right right no not a simple story not one that was easy for me to read but uh im glad he wrote it \n",
            " well thats hogwash yeah thats strictly hogwash im constantly told that it that i im misquoted constantly saying that i i said this and i said that and its not happened right ive always felt that my attorneys were handling it and and they said to keep a low profile and stay away from it and uh in light of all that has been used against me in the media theyve theyve created this fantasy monster image and its been going on for the last twelve years and ive ever had no comment and i had no uh need to talk to the media for the simple reason that they were looking for sensationalism and they were looking for the monster well the idea that that im im uh a homosexual thrill killer and all that that garbage and uh they painted this image of me that like i i strolled down the streets and stalked young boys and i slaughtered them hell if you could see my schedule my work schedule you know damn well that i was never out there thats correct yeah i was gonna ask you in so far as sound goes if im down with my head does that hurt your sound quality i aint gonna break in any song well go into the lead in as to as you know you were at nineteen seventy eight you were present what do you got there lets see your list uh bleeping of the language i will watch the language well i i call it as i see it some people cant understand that alright so whenever the hell theyre ready i started doing painting and then i started doing wallpapering and decorating and inside of three years uh pdm which is painting decorating and maintenance was doing a million dollars a year and i only had four employees thats correct pdm in nineteen seventy four became a corporation and then i owned pdm contractors corporation i owned pdm plumbing pdm concrete and pdm decorating and then i branched off with another partner into rafco construction and from there uh we were doing strictly drugstores no according according uh afterwards theyre claiming that they came to the front door of the house and knocked on the door and that i hid from them there was no way i coulda heard them i was i was way in the back of the house in the rec room on the telephone when they walked finally walked walked around the side of the house i could look out the picture window see them there because i was on the phone and they could see me clearly too sitting on the couch on the telephone because i was talking to my sister in regards to a death in our family so i i told her that i would call her back got up went to the door and they and he introduced himself as koloz and zack and pickell and and he wanted to come in and talk to me about uh robert piest and i had told him that i had not had any conversation with him but i said if you wanna talk to me then come back there and they wanted me to come down to the police station okay well i didnt have time because i was doing work for the county and and stuff like that went into the police station finally on the next day after this was after kozendak and pakel were at the house they had asked me to come in and uh give me an account of my whereabouts the thing of it is is that uh uh on that same day they held me there at for for nine hours and while holding me there for nine hours they executed a search warrant the first search warrant was executed on december thirteenth that is the search warrant where they claimed they went through the house looking for robert peace it was written up to be looking for robert peace and robert peace wasnt there uh recently on december thirteenth i had made a statement to the police department and from that date forward uh they were had me under surveillance the only trouble is is that the the mickey mouse way they were doing it they had two cars following me day and night and they had trouble keeping up with me so i used to go out to the car in the morning and tell them where i was going so in case i got lost because at the time i was doing five construction jobs in five parts of the city so in an essence i was all over the place but this was like keystone cops trying to follow me around yeah missus roslyn carter well the the secret service tries to cover it up and said well we dont know how he got into the picture uh hell i was in charge of the uh reception i had to stand at the door and let them know which politicians were allowed in and which ones werent the thing of it is but the uh the secret service wanted to cover up and make it sound like that i had no business there i was cleared and i was with the secret service at the time in setting up the parade route and everything because i used to set up the parades for the polish alliance and then for three years in a row i had set up the parades to to run and you know thats a big feat getting uh twenty thousand polish people to go in one direction at one time the subdivision uh where the summerdale house is located is built on a clay field and when it rained the rain would come down from both ends and would flood from from one house to the other the crawl space would fill up with water in uh nineteen seventy six i asked a landscaper i said what do you do for for the the sour odor of clay he said spread white lime just regular masonry lime on the ground he said itll sweeten up the clay and you wont have that odor sort of like what charcoal does in filtering things thats why the lime was spread in the crawl space uh i think seven or eight hundred pounds of it the first search warrant was executed on december thirteenth however what is strange is you had twenty trained officers that came into that house supposedly went down in the crawl space crawled around there was no mounds of dirt there was no odor there was no nothing i never feared anybody going down the crawl space the clowning was relaxation for me i enjoyed entertaining kids like some people are uh you know they they unwind in different ways either either were going out drinking or that i could put on clown makeup and i was relaxed and i enjoyed doing it i was uh twice it was only twice a month that i did it yeah no we would visit uh different hospitals and entertain the children there and we didnt entertain them with handcuffs or anything like that all we used was uh balloon animals and small toys and stuff like that but we also did parades and in the summertime like on fourth of july i used to be in four parades in one day ive always told people when when i got into clown makeup i regressed into childhood it was fun being a clown because you could you you could be yourself or or just let yourself go and act a fool you could be slapstick and funny and have a good time uh thats why i always enjoyed clowning clowning has taken a bad name i because of what theyve used in my case nineteen sixty eight the basis of this it was a sodomy conviction its the only thing i i ever was sentenced to was a sodomy conviction theyre claiming that the state representatives son who was on the other party uh he claims that he was sexually abused by me and in essence he was blackmailing me for it now what it boiled down to was oral copulation and it was uh consensual i moved to waterloo iowa i was honored as man of the year because besides working full time i also you know i was a chaplain for the jcs and also ran the membership campaign and of course we used pornography uh we had stag shows and thats how we increase the membership from a hundred and fifty to four hundred four hundred members in that jc chapter we were dealing with porno films and we we had a girl set up in a room in there so it it was you know the the thing to do we were boosting membership from it so nobody said a word about it at the time uh this young individual made the charge at me he was blackmailing me mailing me he wanted more and more money he said look i gave you a blowjob now you you gotta pay for this you gotta i said uh go go see your father he wasnt getting along with his father but they came down heavy on me \n",
            " well im not an expert im not an authority im someone who has been a murderer for almost twenty years it would be a guess but its not its far more than thirty five it isnt that impossible in this society it happens they didnt give up he she didnt give up i did i came in out of the cold and what im saying is there are some people who prefer it in the cold a nice guy i lived as an ordinary person most of my life even though i was living a parallel on an increasingly sick life other life one victim let me back in the car i locked myself out she opened the door for me my gun was under the seat what in the hell am i doing telling you that am i looking am i am i masochist am i looking to be tormented further im trying to show you just how awful this got how commanding these rages got i was raging inside there was just incredible energies positive and negative uh depending on a mood that would trigger one or the other and outside i looked troubled at times other times i looked moody uh other times perfectly serene not very sane but again people werent even aware of what was yes i was also involved in killing coeds because my mother was associated with college work college coeds women and had had a very strong and violently outspoken position on men for much of my upbringing my mother was a sick angry hungry and very sad woman i hated her but i wanted to love my mother and i watched the alcohol increase i watched her social life drop off i watched her get bizarre she had terrible pain from her life earlier life her upbringing uh a failed marriage with my father im a constant reminder of that failure i hate to distill it down into such uh into one word realities like that theres a lot that leads into that happening but that is what happened they represented not what my mother was but what she liked what she coveted what was important to her and i was destroying it my frustration my inability to communicate socially sexually i wasnt impotent but emotionally i was impotent i was scared to death of failing in male female relationships i knew absolutely nothing about that whole area even if just sitting down and talking with the young lady i need to be able to really communicate and ironically enough thats why i began picking people up and im picking up young women and im going a little bit farther each time its a daring kind of a thing at first there wasnt a gun im driving along we go to a vulnerable place there arent people watching where i could act out and i say no i cant and then a gun is in the car hidden and this craving this awful raging eating feeling inside i could feel it consuming my insides this fantastic passion uh it was overwhelming me it was like drugs it was like alcohol a little isnt enough at first it is and as you adjust to that psychologically and physically you take more and more and more its the same process so it finally came down to the thing of do i dare bring this gun out already realizing if that gun comes out something has to happen it was going to happen i didnt see it then but it was going to happen i was playing a dangerous game with a loaded gun it got us all in the first killing in may of seventy two when that gun was pulled out i launched it out afraid i had it under my leg out of sight parallel to my to my leg in the seat it was something that had been thought out in fantasy acted out felt out hundreds of times before it ever happened i just gone through a horrible experience with her roommate stabbing her and i was in shock because of that i couldnt believe that it was that way and im walking back there bewildered i gotta kill her i cant let her go shes gonna tell on me everybodys gonna get me she sees the blood on my hands what are you doing she pulled back and she gasped and i think woah i dont want her to know what happened i said your friend got smart with me i couldnt deal with telling her that and when i attacked her she didnt at first realize what was happening it didnt go through she had very heavy coveralls on it knocked her right up into the lid of the car but it didnt pierce the clothing so wasnt that swell a knife anyway i went out and bought a pawn shop huge knife and uh i kept on it just mindlessly attacking she falls back into the trunk i just killed a young woman i slammed down the lid of the trunk she isnt dead shes dying and i panicked i thought i just locked the car keys in there because i cant find them in my pocket oh my god i locked them in the trunk im kicking on the trunk lid and yanking on it oh no i dont believe this i started to run and i tripped over the gun that id had in my pants that i had totally forgotten was there i stopped i said stop and think i collected my wits check all your pockets i picked the gun up i stuck it back in my pants now remembering i had one i checked all my pockets and theres the keys in the back pocket i never put them in my back pocket i thought i was pretty slick and went and tripped all over myself that first two murders the first twenty four hours there were three clear times i should have been busted and i wasnt because three different individuals or three different groups of people got scared and minded their own business and looked the other way my mother worked at the campus and i had an ace sticker on my car an obvious access day or night to the campus i was picking up some very lovely young women you know what we were talking about as were driving around almost as often as not this guy thats going around doing this stuff and the second they started talking that they didnt realize it but they were getting a free ride i couldnt touch that with a ten foot pole i swear you know but theyd be telling me what all about this guy and theyre comparing notes speculating on what he looks like how he carries himself why hes doing this stuff telling me about it she judged me not to be that guy i didnt look like it its getting easier to do i was getting better at it i was getting less detectable i started flaunting that invisibility severing a human head two of them at night in front of my mothers residence with her at home my neighbors at home upstairs their picture window open the curtains open eleven oclock at night the lights are on all they have to do is walk by look out and ive had it something out of my childhood i could put it on an incident i mean my father chopping the heads off of our two pet chickens and my mother insisting that i eat them for dinner uh you know we could say it was something that simple i dont think it was now my dad heads out back with a hatchet to i got on my bike and i rode it i tried to stop it i remember that i got on the bike rode around the block i was crying i havent talked about that for a lot of years im sure that may have implemented something that may have gotten something rolling but along fantasy lines but it took a lot of years of development along those lines to really get off living through a fantasy however that would relate to that severed head and then five minutes later id put that away and thered be a knock on the door and id put it away and answer the door and the landlady would be there and we discuss it reality her reality not mine some people go crazy at that point i felt it it was one hell of a tweak i mean to just flip out and not know where i was to be walking up the stairs with a camera bag that belonged to a young woman that had her severed head in it walking up to my apartment past a happy young couple coming down the stairs who nodded and smiled at me as they went by good evening and theyre going out on a date where id love to be going and im aware of both of these realities and the the distance between those two was so dramatic so amazing so violent that that really i could feel the wheels squeaking inside that was really pulling on it and i imagine at that point some people break but i didnt literally go insane i didnt get lost \n",
            "that would be nice id like to use the restroom if i may isaiah i s a i a h emmanuel i m m a n u e l david d a v i d ten eighteen fifty three my home is heaven thats the only address i can give you you have in your possession the book of emmanuel david isaiah its with its with my thing thats right that tells you who i am and what im about lord god the almighty through god yes through me read the book power of god by the power of almighty god he worked as by the power of the holy ghost he put on her heart that she knew that i was the lords true servant i didnt convert her to anything the holy ghost converts holy spirit converts the spirit of god she was converted by the spirit of god when you read the book youll understand yes to ask me what i was who i am its like to ask me if im someone other than who i am you see to place me in a in a position where i am not in other words ive forsaken the world and all of the world mhmm and im a new creature in christ and its as immaterial to ask me or to answer such a question because it its its its absolutely immaterial i understand its its i know its not immaterial to you because this is how you work in the world but if you were to take as the savior of the world who he was you wouldnt say im the son of joseph who mary born in nazareth he would not mhmm theres no recorded incident where he is found saying that he will say my father has sent me i came to do the will of the father im not jesus christ but im youre im im his servant im the lords servant and he had called me and hes called me out of the world and so i have no part in the world so i have no part in those questions or answers that youre seeking about anything other than who i am now okay her name is sherjarjar s h e r e a r s h e r s h e a r shear jash hello jashud is j a j a s h u b she her once again that that question shes eighteen wbecause the lord has said shes she is such yes but you say you say eighteen you say eighteen im not thats not who i am i

will set all men free let me just say and and and that when jesus christ was questioned his answers didnt please them either they were very angry with him joseph smith is a true prophet of god yes he did yes it is what was jesus christ accused of i have been absolutely faithful to the righteous laws of this land amen i am because all all righteous laws flow from god but not all laws are righteous and not all laws come from god and the constitution of the united states was founded on righteous prison principles that when you read the book of emmanuel and that this nation has become the most corrupt and evil nation on the face of the earth i mean why because theyve been given great light truth and knowledge and theyve perverted the right ways of the lord and theyre filled with idolatry and wickedness and those who have greater truth have greater evil theres no greater goodness with greater truth possible but theres also greater evil because when you have greater truth you can put on all the appearances of righteousness and pervert the right ways of the lord and this is what this night in this country has done because theyve had great blessings great life truth and knowledge even coming down from god through you know the divine constitution and and uh and christians coming here for religious freedom and uh not political theres nothing theres nothing unpolitical theres nothing unpolitical if she how how did how was when the children of israel were led into the promised land right but when gods children become an idolatrous and wicked they suffer many things whole history of mankind yeah tears is great suffering they become idolatrous and wicked theyve been taken into captivity theyve been torn apart theyve been slain many things have happen to the lords children when theyve been disobedient it comes in for a landing when the children of israel went in the promised land they destroyed many many peoples and in many cases they took the daughters captive and just destroyed all the men women and children except the daughters were virgins all the boys were destroyed all the men and women were destroyed and the only thing they took captive were the virgin daughters that was the children of israel when they went to the promised land in some cities they the lord commanded them to just take them well the whole earth is a promised land for all of us when the lord when the lord when the lord comes in great power and mighty glory and might hes going to to destroy all the wicked and lift up the poor the sick and afflicted the humble followers of the

was down just doing just sunbathing and then she turned over before she turned over she always fastened her bra and turned over and maybe a little bit up here to show because you know tan marks and i i i stared and looked out all the time i had a fantasy yes um see if wanting to uh have sex touch her feel her body have her show me how to have sex um because mothers teach a lot of things you know

her two different uh things when she was always doctor doctor jack replied when shes down there shes a sex fantasy sex object when shes up there trying to get me to read and shes uh uh the other side of of something uh something i hated i love the part of her being a sex object but i didnt like the part of her being a mother and um working with me as trying to help me in reading and and i like this sex part better than i like the the mother that was always trying to hurt uh belittle me and uh because i wasnt uh i wasnt uh i wasnt learning mhmm uh one of them was as you as i they would uh when we went in get the car lets say shes always in the car driving down the road and she first she wants to see my id so i whipped out my id and with my id would be my i put my finger over my drivers license to hide my name but on the opposite side was um pictures and a picture of my son and they would see to see my son and they would know i was a probably normal person this is only about the time i didnt wanna picture my ex wife there so i had to picture my son i had a drivers license on one side my id and then when i showed my and then can the next picture was was my son so that was and uh in the vehicle i had some uh always had some not always but then some of my sons stuff in there you know that you left in there or something star wars or something like that and also there was there was like a family setting yes every time i opened up my wallet there would be a picture of my son on one side uh you know behind my id heres my id i hide i had my name flip it over and theres my id and uh my sons picture on the backside and theyd see that and that would lower any big defenses mhmm and kids toys eight year old toys on the on the dash that happened once it was uh july eighteenth and it

one time he was sleeping and i picked up another prostitute but i didnt\n",
            " every time i look at someone i see flashes of images of me killing them in numerous ways and numerous horrible ways doing terrible things i cant help it its just what comes into my head when i see them i want to hurt people i want to kill people but i dont want to want that choking you the dust with your tie beating your face into the mirror till it broke smashing your face into the wall nothing personal i felt scraping bone a few times bleeding everywhere he was like gargling and stuff i should have been at my house with my mom on the weekends i usually just stay there probably playing video games or playing guitar usually what i do on my weekends is either i have somebody over i just hang out and play video games or play music not exactly but i dont really go places other than my friends house so i know that i dont think we hung out that weekend im pretty sure i was at my house and if i wasnt at my house then i was at well to be honest i mean with davis when something like that happens here like holy crap everybody knows about it knows about it i think they were like an elderly couple or something i know that somebody broke in and like stabbed these two people but i dont really know anything else breaking and entering well not the actual one uh but i know i was looking near my dads i know we drove by a couple times and we saw like the police tape and everything in that area uh like a week after it happened or something like that it was soon enough to where there was still a tape up and everything and there were like all the cop cars were there but i dont really know anything else i know we drove by it i havent heard any of these rumors that you like i havent heard anything about it i havent heard anyone say anything about me in regards to it like honestly i havent heard anything about me in regards to that i dont know why it would be there why people would anyone would spread a rumor like honestly i i havent heard anything about me but i dont im pretty sure if you ask my mom shell say i live there i dont know i dont how would anyone else prove that i mean i know if youre looking for an alibi that that would be it i had nothing to do with it i was its just a lazy weekend its alright yeah yeah pretty much yeah like parents split mom disappeared for a few months left with dad who was well he has a temper problem and you know just lost his wife so hes gonna be pissed off and so that wasnt really fun and since then i dont know every year it seems like you know theres a new like bad thing to happen or a new crock of shit to be added into the pile it was really selfish honestly because like she left with this she left with a chick like and i dont know what happened with that but she was involved in my life for a few years and that pissed me off its like really care about your own happiness more than your childrens thats thats not right i know the way i see it when youre a parent its kinda you made it your duty to nurture your kids and take care of them and make sure that theyre okay uh not good he never hit me or my sister but he hit like the walls or he hit like you know inanimate objects hed yell and uh its that kinda kinda stereotypical just pissed off dad only yeah shes older shes seventeen she was a really bad attention seeking habitual liar a manipulator of my parents and you know when youre a little kid and you see that shes manipulating them and you try to tell them they dont believe you because youre just a kid you dont know whats going on supposedly what exactly are you i guess trying to get from me yeah tumblr i heard about it i made one on my page or on tumblr in general um song lyrics uh things like miniature things about like what i feel a lot of stuff from horror movies because i like horror movies um gore pretty much it just music and scary stuff yeah well since i was a little kid i liked horror movies ive been watching them like for a long time in a way it kinda is um dark screwed up sense of humor and actually a lot of that stuff makes me laugh right i see that i dont know not a lot of stuff makes me laugh mhmm and so its like i like horror movies and its just its the same thing as a horror movie only its real in the sense that i dont have any connection to whoever it happened to it doesnt really bother me yeah seriously like it makes me feel something and ive just always kinda been into darker stuff i dont know it makes me feel like shocked and im fascinated with anatomy and so like the you i dont know you can see what happened to them and how warped their bodies are and just kind of fascinating to think like what could have done that how did that happen why did that happen just how did this all come to play and i dont know sometimes theyll be like in a funny pose or something and theyll just look like stupid and so ill like giggle at it whats the concern with that though its tumblr theres also a lot of stuff thats like its relevant to whats going on today like theres a lot of it is just um stuff thats happening in syria and its like holy crap this is actually going on right now and no ones doing anything about it just kinda like a real life horror movie mhmm i dont really make the distinction you know its brutal and its dark but its interesting to me just the human body its fascinating its i find it fascinating to like see what its on the inside you know like not just this because what makes it all happen what makes it work what isnt just said that like he heard like a rumor or something he didnt really tell me why me he just kinda asked me those stereotypical little questions you know like where were you who were you with uh what do you know what what what would that be me thats ridiculous im a kid well like i dont i dont hurt people like you can ask anyone around me im a compassionate affectionate person i care about people i dont wanna hurt them i mean yeah they piss me off sometimes and they do some messed up but i care about people i dont hurt people what i said that someone broke in and stabbed the people well have you asked the people who have told you that where they were well i mean when someone comes to you and tells you exact details of a murder and then says no this guy did it isnt that kinda like \n"
